<!-- CORE REQUIREMENTS -->
<!-- 
Create a new html file. Add the code necessary to make it a valid document COMPLETED
  1. Add a text input and a button. Put an empty div with an ID below those.
  2. Add a script tag, write a function that will read the contents of the input, and write them to the div.
  3. Call the function when the button is pressed.
-->


<!-- 
Modify your HTML file:
  1. Write a new function that expects a number as an argument. It should take that number and sum all the numbers up to the number provided. (ie n=5…so it would do 1+2+3+4+5 = 15) It should return that value.
  2. When the button is pressed it should read the number from the input. Make sure it is a valid number, call the summing function you just wrote, and output the result to the div. 
-->


<!-- 
Create an adding machine
  1. Add an additional input to your HTML file.
  2. Add a + button.
  3. Write a function that will take the numbers from each input, add them together, and output the result to a div

<!-- STRETCH GOALS -->
<!-- 
Function declaration
  Part of your reading this week is about Javascript Functions. In Javascript there are several ways to define a function: with a function declaration, a function expression, or an arrow function. Add some more features (subtract, multiply, etc) to your calculator. Make sure to use each of the three methods at least once in your function definitions. Discuss with your team the differences and if there is one you prefer.

<!-- 
Writing 'good' functions
  In good program design functions should do one thing and do it well. They should be kept simple. Another good programming practice is to keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). How did you do with your functions? Does each do one thing only? Is there any repeated code? How could you fix this? If you have repeated lines of code in your functions the most common solution is to pull those repeated lines out and create a new function with them. Do this with your code. 
-->




<!-- 
Callbacks
  In Javascript functions can be passed as the argument into another function. When this is done the function being passed in is called a callback.

  Discuss with your team how callbacks might be used in programming a calculator to help keep your functions simple and your code DRY. If you have time try to implement one of your ideas.
